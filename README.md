# icenet-project

Central repository for the [British Antarctic Survey (BAS)](https://www.bas.ac.uk) / [Alan Turing Institute (ATI)](https://turing.ac.uk) IceNet Project.

This project __originally developed__ a proof-of-concept foundational infrastructure in 2021 to support ongoing developments. This repository __now__ helps us to manage the ongoing collaboration.

## Working Group

An IceNet working group liaises between The Alan Turing Institute and British Antarctic Survey to track the many ongoing interests and developments in IceNet. This group is currently formed of [project team members from BAS](https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/icenet/#people) and [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/understanding-arctic-sea-ice-loss), led by [James Byrne](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/jambyr/) and [Alden Connor](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/business-team/alden-conner).
